### A brief overview and history

CNext is developed to streamline the process of developing and deploying models at scale. The genesis for this platform came about from our frustrations hacking together point solutions and maintaining backend abstractions tying everything together.&#x20;

At it's core the platform allows for:

* Data exploration / transformation
* Experiment management / model exploration
* Production code generation / deployment\*
* Error Analysis\*
* Collaboration\*

Items marked with (\*) are still in development - if you would like to share any feedback on these areas please don't hesitate to reach out.&#x20;
